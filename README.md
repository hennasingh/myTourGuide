# myTourGuide
Tour Guide App. This is 6th project in Android Scholarship program. The goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting any city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know.

I have made a mix of cities and states, some categories are repeated, only to depict the way of adding them. A gif as below.
